## Before Installing Notes
- After the Necrom Chapter the entire codebase was reworked, and most ugly logic code is now in LibMapThemer, if there is a non-visual bug within AccurateWorldMap it's probably from LMT and should be reported [there](https://github.com/XiokroDarc/LibMapThemer/issues).
- Any bugs found in general should be reported to me and not Thal-J or Vylaera

## Installation
- Make sure you have [LibMapThemer](https://github.com/XiokroDarc/LibMapThemer) installed
- Install addon into ESO addon directory
- Enjoy

## Notes
- After installing, the world map will be completely different and almost nothing will be in the same place as before. This is intentional, and may/will break many addons that rely on the placement of the wayshrines.
- Player icons may not align correctly on the world map. This is not a game breaking feature, however until a reliable solution is found, the bug will remain.


## Compatibility

Many addons that add pins to vanilla locations on the world map are not compatible, this is because Accurate World Map moves zones and pins from their vanilla locations and those addons require vanilla positioning.

#### Compatible
- True Exploration
- DarkUI
- Any addon that doesn't effect the map or wayshrines

#### Partial Compatibility / Unknown
- Votan's Improved Locations
- More that idk about

#### Not Compatible
- GuildShrines
- Any addon that effects the map or wayshrines in any major way
